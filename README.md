# ETOP: Employee Token Option Agreement Template

As more start-ups turn to ICO's and protocol tokens, the classical approach to employee stock option agreements may no longer make sense. This is an attempt to create a new form of option agreement for employees at a start-up that completes an ICO.

## Motivations

Tokens and token offerings are a new approach to technology monetization. Attempting to build a business around a decentralized currency can prove challenging. Our motivation is to spark discussion around how start-ups can appropriately incentivize their employees if they take a token-issuance route. It is not clear that this model is optimal, but it is all we have so far.

## Work in Progress

Keep in mind this is a work in progress. Pull requests, forks and comments are encouraged.

## Prior works

This is based loosely on Bitaccess's original Employee stock option agreement, which is based on the laws of Ontario, Canada. If you are in the US/elsewhere, it might be a good idea to see if you need additional provisions

## Vesting

The default vesting period is set to 4 years, with an initial 1 year cliff.

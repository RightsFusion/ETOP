### 6.	Vesting

Unless otherwise approved by the Board and agreed to in writing by the Company in the Token Option Agreement to be executed by a Participant, the Options granted under the Plan must be exercised within a period of ten (10) years from the Date of Grant, failing which the Option shall expire; provided that, should the expiry date of any vested Option fall on, or within nine (9) trading days immediately following, a date upon which a Participant is prohibited from exercising such Option due to a black-out period or other trading restriction imposed by the Company, then the expiry date of such Option shall instead be ten trading days following the date the relevant black-out period or other trading restriction imposed by the Company is lifted, terminated or removed.  

Unless otherwise approved and/or amended by the Board and specifically set forth in a Token Option Agreement, the vesting periods within this ten (10) year period during which Option Tokens or a portion thereof vest and may be exercised by a Participant shall be as follows:  

25% of the Options granted shall vest on the first anniversary of the Date of Grant; and

(b) 	6.25% of the Options granted shall vest on the first day of each calendar quarter following the first anniversary of the Date of Grant;

so that on the fourth anniversary of the Date of Grant, all of the Options granted will have vested and will be exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant.

Notwithstanding any particular Vesting Period the Board may, in its sole discretion, by written notice to any Participant, accelerate the vesting of all or any portion of any Option so that any such Option may become immediately fully vested and exercisable.  In such circumstances, the Board may by written notice require a Participant to exercise any such Option within thirty (30) days of the date of such written notice, failing which exercise such Participant’s right to exercise such Option and purchase the Option Tokens underlying such Option shall immediately lapse and be of no further force or effect.

Notwithstanding any particular Vesting Period, in the event of a Change in Control, the Board may, in its sole discretion and without any action or consent required on the part of any Participant and notwithstanding any Token Option Agreement, deal with the Options granted under the Plan in the manner it deems fair and reasonable in light of the circumstances of the Change in Control, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

Accelerating the vesting of any or all outstanding Options to provide that such outstanding Options shall be fully vested and conditionally exercisable upon (or prior to) the completion of the Change in Control, provided, however, that the Board shall not, in any case, authorize the exercise of Options pursuant to this Section beyond the date of expiry of such Options.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, if the Board elects to accelerate the vesting of any Options, and if any such Options are not exercised within ten (10) business days following the giving of the notice contemplated below, such unexercised Options shall terminate and expire upon the completion of the proposed Change in Control.  If, for any reason, the Change in Control does not occur within the contemplated time period, the acceleration of the vesting of the Options shall be retracted and vesting shall instead revert to the manner provided in the second paragraph of this Section;

Effect a “cashless exercise”, by applying a portion of the proceeds that would be received by a Participant from the Change in Control transaction to the exercise price payable by that Participant for the exercise of his or her Options, and, as applicable, issuing the balance of the tokens, or paying the balance of the proceeds, to the Participant; and/or

To the extent that the Change in Control would also result in a capital reorganization, arrangement, amalgamation or reclassification of the share capital of the Company and the Board does not accelerate the vesting of Options pursuant to this Section, the Company shall make adequate provisions to ensure that, upon completion of the proposed Change in Control, the number and kind of tokens subject to outstanding Options and/or the Option Price per token of Options shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as the Board considers equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to Participants.

The Company may apply any of the foregoing methods to Options based on whether they are vested or unvested, in-the-money or not, or otherwise.  Upon the Company entering into an agreement relating to and publicly announcing a transaction which, if completed, would result in a Change in Control, the Company shall give written notice of the proposed Change in Control to each Participant that holds Options at such date, together with a description of the effect of such Change in Control on outstanding Options, not less than five (5) business days prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the Change in Control.

### 7.	Payment and Conditions of Exercise of Options

Subject to Section 6, from time to time and at any time after the vesting of any Options and prior to the lapse of such Options, a Participant may elect to purchase all or a portion of the Option Tokens available for purchase by delivering to the Company a completed Token Option Purchase Form and payment in full of the purchase price for such Option Tokens.  Such Token Option Purchase Form shall specify the number of Option Tokens the Participant desires to purchase.  Payment may be made certified cheque, bank draft, money order or digital currency transfer the equivalent payable to the order of <--COMPANY NAME--> Inc.  To the extent permitted by applicable laws and the regulations of the Exchange, if applicable, upon written request of the Participant, the Company may, in its sole discretion, opt to permit to allow the Participant to satisfy the foregoing payment obligations by reducing the number of Option Tokens received by the Participant upon exercise of the Options by a number of Option Tokens representing the number of Tokens required to satisfy the aggregate exercise price if such Tokens were sold at the Fair Market Value of the <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens determined at the time of exercise.

In the event that the Option Tokens are not listed on the Exchange as at the date of an exercise of an Option, it shall be a condition precedent to the exercise of any Option that the Participant agree to be bound by the terms of any unanimous tokenholders agreement or similar agreements generally applicable to all of the shareholders of the Company then in force, and further that the Participant agree to enter into voting trust generally applicable to employee shareholders of the Company then in force and provide a power of attorney in support of such voting trust.

### 8.	Blockchain Token Transfer

Upon exercise of the Option and payment in full of the purchase price the Company shall cause to be delivered to the Participant within a reasonable period of time a Blockchain Token Transfer to a blockchain address provided by the Participant representing the number of Option Tokens the Participant has purchased.  In the event that the Tokens are not listed on the blockchain as at the date of an exercise of an Option, the original blockchain tokens(s) may be held in trust by the Company, to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Token Option Agreement, and any shareholders agreement of the Company in effect and applicable to the Participant at such time.

### 9.	Adjustment in Tokens

Appropriate adjustments in the number of <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens subject to the Plan and, as regards Options granted or to be granted, in the number of <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens optioned and in the Option Price, shall be made by the Committee to give effect to adjustments in the number of <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens resulting from sub-divisions, consolidations or re-classifications of the <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens or other relevant changes in the authorised or issued capital of the Company.

Furthermore, in the event of a Change in Control, the Board may, in its sole discretion, deal with the Options issued under the Plan in the manner it deems fair and reasonable in light of the circumstances of the change, including without limitation, taking any of the actions outlined in Section 6 hereof and/or making such other adjustments to the number and kind of tokens which thereafter may be offered and sold to Participants under the Plan as it may deem equitable.

### 10.	Termination of Participant

Unless otherwise approved by the Board or agreed to in writing by the Company in the Token Option Agreement to be executed by a Participant, the following terms shall apply:

In the event that:

a Participant’s employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries is terminated; or

the services with the Company or any of its subsidiaries of a Participant who is a Consultant are terminated; or

a Participant who is a Director shall cease to be a Director (provided that if Director is also an Employee, clause (i) must also apply)

for any reason other than (A) for cause (as defined in accordance with a Participant’s employment or other applicable agreement, or, if not so defined, as determined by applicable law) or (B) as a result of death or disability of a Participant (any such event being referred to as a “Termination without Cause”), then this Section 10(a) shall apply.  The date on which a Participant is notified of a Termination without Cause is hereinafter referred to in this Section 10(a) as the “Termination Date”.  On a Termination without Cause, the Company may, at its sole discretion, at any time within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of such termination, repurchase any <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens purchased by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of Options granted hereunder at a price per token equal to the Fair Market Value on the date of such repurchase. Subject to the foregoing, a Participant may exercise the Option to purchase any Option Tokens that have vested prior to the Termination Date for a period of ninety (90) days following after the Termination Date (but in no event after the expiry of any Options held).  Upon the expiry of such 90-day period, all unexercised Options held by the Participant shall lapse.  For the purposes of this Plan, the transfer of the Employee’s employment to the Company from any Related Entity or from the Company to any Related Entity of the Company shall not be considered a termination of employment and the Employee’s rights under the Option shall be the same as if such transfer had not occurred.  In the event that the Participant has violated any obligations to the Company set out in any agreements with the Company (or applicable at law) pertaining to (i) non-disclosure of the confidential information of the Company, (ii) ownership of inventions, or (iii) dealings with employees or customers of the Company, then all unexercised options which have otherwise vested in the Participant shall become immediately null and void and neither exercisable nor enforceable.

(b)	In the event that an Employee’s employment or Consultant’s services with the Company or any of its subsidiaries is terminated by reason of death or disability or a Director shall cease to be a Director on the Board by reason of death or disability, then the Company may, at its sole discretion, at any time within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of such termination, repurchase any <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens purchased by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of Options granted hereunder at a price per token equal to the Fair Market Value on the date of such repurchase. Subject to the foregoing, the applicable Participant, or the Participant’s personal representatives, may exercise the Option to purchase any Option Tokens that have vested at the time such employment, services or board position is terminated at any time during the ninety (90) day period following the date of such termination of employment, services or Board position (but in no event after the expiry of any Options held), and upon the expiry of such ninety (90) day period, all unexercised Options held by the Participant (or the Participant’s personal representatives, as applicable) shall lapse.

(c)	In the event that an Employee’s employment or Consultant’s services with the Company or any of its subsidiaries is terminated for cause or a Director shall cease to be a Director for breach of fiduciary duty (as defined in accordance with the Participant’s employment or other applicable agreement, or, if not so defined, as determined by applicable law), then all vested and unexercised Options held by the Participant shall lapse immediately upon the delivery to the Participant of the notice of termination.  Further, the Company may, at its sole discretion, at any time within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of such termination, repurchase any <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens purchased by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of Options granted hereunder, at a price per token equal to the Option Price per <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens.  This Section 10(c) shall cease to apply after the Tokens are listed on the Exchange.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, at any time prior to or following the events contemplated in this Section 10, permit the exercise of any or all Options held by an Participant in the manner and on the terms authorized by the Board, provided that the Board shall not, in any case, authorize the exercise of an Option pursuant to this Section 10 beyond the expiration of the exercise period of the particular Option.

### 11.	Transfer and Assignment

Subject to Section 10 hereof, Options granted under this Plan may only be exercised during the lifetime of a Participant by such Participant personally and no assignment or transfer of Options, whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, vests any interest or right in such Options whatsoever in any assignee or transferee and immediately upon any assignment or transfer, or any attempt to make the same, such

Options will terminate and be of no further force or effect.  The obligations of each Participant shall be binding on his or her heirs, executors and administrators.

### 12.	Employment, Consulting and Board Position Non-Contractual

The granting of an Option to a Participant under the Plan does not confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employment of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or as a member of the Board, as the case may be, nor does it interfere in any way with the rights of the Employee or Consultant or of the Company’s rights to terminate the Employee’s employment or Consultant’s services at any time or of the shareholders’ right to elect directors.

### 13.	Rights and Obligations as Tokenholders

Participants shall not have any rights as a tokenholders with respect to Option Tokens until:

(a)	full payment has been made to the Company;

(b)	a blockchain token transfer or blockchain token transfers have been duly issued; and

(c)	the Participant becomes a party to any existing unanimous tokenholders agreement and/or any other agreement or voting trust generally applicable to Employees and/or Consultants of the Company.

#### Administration and Application of The Plan

The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  The Committee shall have the power to interpret and construe the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Options.  Any determination by the Committee shall be final and conclusive on all persons affected thereby unless otherwise determined by the Board.  The day-to-day administration of the Plan may be delegated to such officers and employees of the Company or any Related Entity of the Company, or to such outside advisors or consultants to the Company, as the Committee shall determine.  In the Token Option Agreement applicable to a Participant, the Company may modify the terms of this Plan applicable to such Participant, provided that the approval of the Board is obtained for any such modifications and provided further that such modifications are permissible under securities legislation and, if the <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens are listed for trading on the Exchange, the rules of the Exchange.

  Attention:  <--LAWYER NAME-->

Any notice given by a Participant pursuant to the terms of the Option shall not be effective until actually received by the Company at the above address.  Any notice to be given to a Participant shall be sufficiently given if delivered personally (which shall be deemed to be effective at the time of delivery), by facsimile transmission or electronic mail (which shall be deemed to be effective one day after transmission), or by postage prepaid mail to the last address of the Participant on the records of the Company (which shall be deemed to be effective five days after mailing).

#### Corporate Action

Nothing contained in the Plan or in the Option shall be construed so as to prevent the Company or any Related Entity of the Company from taking corporate action that is deemed by the Company or the Related Entity to be appropriate or in its best interest, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on the Plan.

#### Amendments

The Board shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, suspend or terminate this Plan or any portion thereof at any time, in accordance with applicable legislation, without obtaining the approval of shareholders; provided that any amendment to any provision of the Plan will be subject to any required regulatory approval and the provisions of applicable law, if any, that require the approval of shareholders.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens are listed for trading on the Exchange, the Company will be required to obtain the approval of the shareholders of the Company for any amendment related to: (i) the maximum number or percentage of <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens issuable under the Plan; (ii) a reduction in the Option Price of outstanding Options or cancellation of Options for the purpose of issuing new Options; (iii) an extension to the term of outstanding Options; (iv) increasing limits on non-employee director participation; (v) Section 4 of the Plan which would increase the number of <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens reserved for issuance to insiders, at any time, or issued to insiders within any one year period, under the Plan; or (vi) Section 11 which would allow an Option holder to transfer Options other than by will or pursuant to laws of succession. Subject to compliance with the applicable rules of the Exchange, no amendment, suspension or termination will alter or impair any Options under the Plan, or any rights pursuant thereto, granted previously to any Participant without the consent of that Participant.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if the <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens are listed for trading on the Exchange, the Option Price of any Options granted under this Plan must not be lower than the Fair Market Value of the <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens at the time the Option is granted.

#### Termination Of Plan

The Plan will terminate and, for greater certainty, all unexercised Options shall terminate and expire on the earliest of: (i) the date upon which no further <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens remain available for issuance pursuant to Options which may be granted under the Plan and no Options remain outstanding; (ii) if the Board of Directors accelerates the vesting of Options pursuant to any Change in Control, then upon the occurrence of such Change in Control, unless renewed for such further period and upon such terms and conditions as the Board may determine; and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the Plan.

#### Governing Law

The Plan is established under the laws of the Province of Ontario and the rights of all parties and the construction and effect of each provision of the Plan shall be according to the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein.

#### Government Regulation

The Company’s obligation to issue and deliver <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens under any Option is subject to:

the satisfaction of all requirements under applicable securities law in respect thereof and obtaining all regulatory approvals as the Company shall determine to be necessary or advisable in connection with the authorization, issuance or sale thereof, including shareholder approval, if required;

the receipt from a Participant of such representations, agreements and undertakings as to future dealings in such <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens as the Company determines to be necessary or advisable in order to safeguard against the violation of the securities law of any jurisdiction; and

the admission of such Option Tokens to listing on any token exchange on which Option Tokens may then be listed.

In this connection, the Company shall take all reasonable steps to obtain such approvals and registrations as may be necessary for the issuance of such <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens in compliance with applicable securities law and for the listing of such <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens on any token exchange on which such <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens are then listed.

### 22.	Withholding Taxes
The exercise of each Option granted under this Plan is subject to the condition that if at any time the Company determines, in its discretion, that the satisfaction of withholding tax or other withholding liabilities is necessary or desirable in respect of such exercise, such exercise is not effective unless such withholding has been effected to the satisfaction of the Company.  In such circumstances, the Company may require that a Participant pay to the Company, in addition to and in the same manner as the Option Price for the Option Tokens, such amount as the Company is obliged to remit to the relevant taxing authority in respect of the exercise of the Option.  Any such additional payment is due no later than the date as of which any amount with respect to the Option exercised first becomes includable in the gross income of the Participant for tax purposes.
Compliance with Exchange Rules

The Board may make changes to the terms of any Options or this Plan to the extent necessary or desirable to comply with any rules, regulations or policies of the Exchange, provided that the value of previously granted Options and the rights of Participants are not materially adversely affected by any such changes.

### 24. 	Incentive Token Options (US Participants)

The following provisions shall apply, in addition to the other provisions of this Plan that are not inconsistent therewith, to Options intended to qualify as incentive token options (each, an “ISO”) under Section 422 of the United States’ Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”):

Options may be granted as ISOs only to individuals who are employees of the Company or any present or future “subsidiary corporation” or “parent corporation” as those terms are defined in Section 424 of the Code (collectively, “Related Corporations”) and Options shall not be granted as ISOs to non-employee Directors or independent contractors;

for purposes of Section 10 hereof, “disability” in respect of an Participant shall mean “permanent and total disability” as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code;

if a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company and/or all Related Corporations other than by reason of death or disability, Options shall be eligible for treatment as ISOs only if exercised no later than three (3) months following such termination of employment;

Options held by a Participant shall be eligible for treatment as ISOs only if the fair market value (determined at the Date of Grant) of the <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens with respect to which such Options and all other options intended to qualify as “incentive token options” under Section 422 of the Code held by such individual and granted under the Plan or any other plan of the Company or a Related Corporation and which are exercisable for the first time by such individual during any one calendar year does not exceed US$100,000 at such time;

by accepting an Option granted as an ISO under the Plan, a Participant agrees to notify the Company in writing immediately after such Participant makes a “Disqualifying Disposition” of any <--TOKEN NAME--> Tokens acquired pursuant to the exercise of such ISO; for this purpose, a Disqualifying Disposition is any disposition occurring on or before the later of (a) the date two (2) years following the date that such ISO was granted or (b) the date one (1) year following the date that such ISO was exercised;

notwithstanding that the Plan shall be effective when adopted by the Board, no ISO granted under the Plan may be exercised until the Plan is approved by the Company’s shareholders and, if such approval is not obtained within twelve (12) months after the date of the Board’s adoption of the Plan, then all ISOs previously granted shall terminate and cease to be outstanding and the provisions of this Section 4.12 shall cease to have effect; furthermore, the Board shall obtain shareholder approval within twelve (12) months before or after any increase in the total number of tokens that may be issued under the Plan or any change in the class of employees eligible to receive ISOs under the Plan;

no modification of an outstanding Option that would provide an additional benefit to a Participant, including but not limited to a reduction of the Option Price or extension of the exercise period, shall be made without consideration and disclosure of the likely United States federal income tax consequences to the Participants affected thereby; and

ISOs shall be neither transferable nor assignable by the Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and may be exercised, during the Participant’s lifetime, only by such Participant.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 24, the Company makes no representation or warranty to any Participant that any Option will, at the date hereof of any time in future, qualify as an ISO under the Code and each Participant specifically acknowledges this limitation.

### 25.	Indemnification

Every Director will at all times be indemnified and saved harmless by the Company from and against all costs, charges and expenses whatsoever including any income tax liability arising from any such indemnification, that such Director may sustain or incur by reason of any action, suit or proceeding, taken or threatened against the Director, otherwise than by the Company, for or in respect of any act done or omitted by the Director in respect of this Plan, such costs, charges and expenses to include any amount paid to settle such action, suit or proceeding or in satisfaction of any judgment rendered therein.

### 26.	Participation in the Plan
